        <h1>What is AdmitIQ?</h1>
        <p>AdmitIQ is website that helps you determine your chances of getting into a top tier college. Currently, we have calculations for 18 colleges based on our compiled research, and are looking forward to adding more to our list. You can enter in all the fields and AdmitIQ will give you a rough estimate of your likelihood of being accepted into that college, relative to its acceptance rate.</p>
        <h1>How does it work?</h1>
        <p>AdmitIQ uses a point based system to calcuate your likehood of being accepted. Based on each college, we have given a target point total for it, and if your total score comes to within a certain range of that target score, you get an appropriate result. Some aspects are weighted in unique ways. For example, you will recieve 5 points if your SAT score is 1550 or higher, and 3 points if it is 1500 or higher. But considering that these are the most selective of the schools in the world, if your SAT score is below 1500, you will lose points. Additionally, if you are applying to a college, your point total might be different based on your major. For example, if you are applying to MIT for computer science, you won't be rewarded any extra points due to its competitiveness. But, if you applied for medicine, for example, you will recieve 2 bonus points, because it is easier to get into medicine for MIT than computer science.</p>
